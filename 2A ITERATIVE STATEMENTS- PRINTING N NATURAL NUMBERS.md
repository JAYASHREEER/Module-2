## ITERATIVE STATEMENTS â€“ PRINTING N NATURAL NUMBERS

###  Aim
To create a Python program for printing `n` natural numbers using a `for` loop.

###  Algorithm
1.Start
2.Read an integer input n from the user.
3.Print a message: "Natural Numbers are :".
4.Use a for loop from 1 to n:
5.In each iteration, print the current number.
6.End

###  Program
n=int(input())

print("Natural Numbers are :")
for i in range(1,n+1):
    print(i)

### OUTPUT

### RESULT
Thus,Python program for printing `n` natural numbers using a `for` loop was implemented and successfully executed.
