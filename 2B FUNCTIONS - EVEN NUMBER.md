## FUNCTIONS - EVEN NUMBER

### AIM  
To write a Python program to check whether the number '28' is even number is odd.

### ALGORITHM
1.Start
2.Define a function is_even(num) that:
Checks if num % 2 == 0
Returns True if even, False if odd
3.In the main part of the program:
Assign the number 28 to a variable.
Call the function is_even() with 28 as an argument.
If the function returns True, print "28 is an even number"
Otherwise, print "28 is an odd number"
4.End

### PROGRAM
result = lambda a:f"{a} is even" if a %2==0 else f"{a} is odd"
a=int(input())
print(result(a))

### OUTPUT

### RESULT
Thus,Python program to check whether the number '28' is even number is odd was implemented and executed.
