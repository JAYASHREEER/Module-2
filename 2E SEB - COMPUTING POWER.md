## SEB - COMPUTING POWER

### AIM  
To write a Python program to compute the power of a given number using an appropriate built-in function.

### ALGORITHM
1.Start
2.Read or define two numbers:
base (the number to be raised)
exponent (the power)
3.Use the built-in function pow(base, exponent) to compute the result.
4.Store the result in a variable.
5.Display the result.
6.End

### PROGRAM
a=int(input())
b=int(input())
power=lambda a,b:pow(a,b)
print("Power of the given number is:",power(a,b))

### OUTPUT

### RESULT
Thus,  Python program to compute the power of a given number using an appropriate built-in function was implemented and successfully executed.
